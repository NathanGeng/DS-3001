An underrepresented group would be Hispanics, who are less likely to participate due to finances, or a distrust/stigma towards government. Something that could be interpreted as a strength would be their imputation methods to fill in gaps within the dataset using known data values. In the future, a way to fully capture the diverse population could be to train up individuals can bridge the gap between government and underrepresented communities. For example, training more Latin-American workers to go door-to-door during census collection to make individuals feel more at ease.\n",

This is accurate, as sex relates to biological attributes of males and females (based on hormones, chromosome composition, and bodily anatomy). However, the census does not ask about gender, a more socially constructed concept. While there is no obligation or requirement to ask about gender, questions pertaining to it would definitely provide a robust dataset that is more representative of the population as a whole. However, due to the expansive nature of gender, I find it hard to imagine how a question on the census would manage to encapsulate the many different forms of gender one can identify with, forcing people who identify as a gender different from the listed options to check a box labeled \"Other\" at the bottom. I believe that there should be question pertaining to gender, but how effective it would be at representing all backgrounds remains the question.\n",

        "> One major concern would be the privacy of the indivdual when it comes to their willingness to share those characteristics which the government. Even though discrimination based on someone's race, sexual orientation, religion, etc. is wrong, there are still ways it can still occur subliminally. For example, if there are missing values in census data regarding these characteristics, they might be imputed as the \"standard\" choice, leading to a unrepresentative dataset. Or, arguably worse, if the data is correctly filled out, the government can discrimintate against areas with populations that hold certain characteristics (ex: black communities and redlining). To prevent this, a good practice to adopt would be to prevent biases against these groups from occuring in the first place. Also, it is important for the process of data cleaning to be transparent and forthcoming, so any possible source of bias can be detected easily when examining how the data was manipulated.\n",

Assuming that the algorithm is 100% accurate, there still remains the issue of privacy. I am assuming that the purpose of the algorithm is to impute values for these characteristics because participants chose to not disclose them; therefore, the ability for the algorithm to determine characteristics of a participant regardless of their consent or not would be a violation of the privacy of the individual. In a sense, even though the algorithm was intended for good (aiming to fill gaps in data to increase its validity), it could still contribute to potential discriminatory practices like those listed in the previous question."
